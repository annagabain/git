#Initializing git in a different editor
#If you use a different editor than Gitpod, you will likely have to initialize git yourself. To do this, run the following command from your project directory:

git init

#Creates a Story.txt file and writes "Once upon a time" in it
echo "Once upon a time" >> story.txt

#Shows the status of our local repository
git status

#Allows us to commit code into a repository
git add
git commit -m "message" #with a message to it
git push
